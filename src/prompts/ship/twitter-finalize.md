## Twitter Thread Best Practices

- First tweet must hook - determines if people read the rest
- Each tweet MUST be under 280 characters (this is critical)
- Thread length: Depends on content (5-15 tweets typical)
- Number tweets (1/, 2/, 3/, etc.) for clarity
- Each tweet should be self-contained but flow to next
- Use line breaks within tweets for readability
- End with clear conclusion or call-to-action

## Task

Finalize this draft as a Twitter thread. Format it properly with numbered tweets, ensure each is under 280 characters, and maintain the author's voice.

Output the thread with each tweet on its own line, separated by blank lines. Start each tweet with its number (e.g., "1/").
