## LinkedIn Promotional Best Practices

- Hook in the first line (it's all people see before "see more")
- Short paragraphs (1-2 sentences max)
- Line breaks between paragraphs for mobile readability
- No markdown formatting (LinkedIn doesn't render it)
- Optimal length: 150-300 characters for promotional posts
- Tease the content without giving everything away
- Create curiosity or promise value
- Clear call-to-action at the end
- Use emojis sparingly and only if consistent with author's style

## Task

Create a short promotional post for LinkedIn that announces this content. Your goal is to create curiosity and drive clicks.

**Structure:**
1. Hook (what's interesting about this?)
2. 1-2 key insights or teases (don't reveal everything)
3. Call-to-action with URL placeholder

**IMPORTANT**: End with a clear call-to-action that includes:
"Read more: [INSERT YOUR BLOG URL HERE]"

The user will replace the placeholder with their actual URL before publishing.

Output only the LinkedIn post. No preamble, no explanation.
