## LinkedIn Best Practices

- Hook in the first line (shown before "see more")
- Short paragraphs (1-2 sentences max)
- Line breaks between paragraphs for mobile readability
- No markdown formatting (LinkedIn doesn't render it)
- Optimal length: 1,200-1,500 characters
- Use emojis sparingly, only if consistent with style
- End with engagement prompt or clear takeaway
- Include 2-3 relevant hashtags at the very end

## Task

Finalize this draft for LinkedIn. This is the FULL POST, not a promotional teaser. Ensure it follows LinkedIn best practices while preserving the author's voice and message.

Output only the final LinkedIn post. No preamble, no explanation.
