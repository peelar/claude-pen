## Twitter Promotional Thread Best Practices

- First tweet must hook - it determines if anyone reads the rest
- Create curiosity without revealing the full content
- Thread length: 2-4 tweets ideal for promotional content
- Each tweet MUST be under 280 characters (this is critical)
- Each tweet should build interest
- End with clear call-to-action
- No numbering for short promotional threads (only number if 5+ tweets)
- Last tweet should include the link (if provided)

## Task

Create a short promotional thread (2-4 tweets) that announces this content. Your goal is to create curiosity and drive clicks.

**Structure:**
1. Hook tweet (what's the big idea?)
2. 1-2 supporting tweets (tease key insights)
3. Call-to-action tweet with link

{{#if url}}
Include this link in the final tweet: {{url}}
{{else}}
End with: "🔗 Link in bio" or "Read more: [link]"
{{/if}}

Output only the thread with each tweet on its own line, separated by blank lines. No preamble, no explanation, no tweet numbers for short threads.
