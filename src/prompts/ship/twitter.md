## Twitter Promotional Thread Best Practices

- First tweet must hook - it determines if anyone reads the rest
- Create curiosity without revealing the full content
- Thread length: 2-4 tweets ideal for promotional content
- Each tweet MUST be under 280 characters (this is critical)
- Each tweet should build interest
- End with clear call-to-action
- No numbering for short promotional threads (only number if 5+ tweets)
- Last tweet should include the link (if provided)

## Task

Create a short promotional thread (2-4 tweets) that announces this content. Your goal is to create curiosity and drive clicks.

**Structure:**
1. Hook tweet (what's the big idea?)
2. 1-2 supporting tweets (tease key insights)
3. Call-to-action tweet with URL placeholder

**IMPORTANT**: Final tweet should include:
"Read the full post: [INSERT YOUR BLOG URL HERE]"

The user will replace the placeholder with their actual URL before publishing.

Output only the thread with each tweet on its own line, separated by blank lines. No preamble, no explanation, no tweet numbers for short threads.
