## Task

Apply a proofread refinement pass to the content below. Your goal is to fix errors while preserving the author's unique voice and style.

1. **Fix grammar** - Correct grammatical errors, subject-verb agreement, tense consistency
2. **Fix spelling** - Correct typos and misspellings
3. **Fix punctuation** - Ensure proper punctuation usage
4. **Fix awkward phrasing** - Rewrite sentences that are unclear or clumsy
5. **Preserve voice** - Maintain the author's tone, word choice, and personality

Important:
- Do NOT change the author's vocabulary choices unless they're objectively wrong
- Do NOT reorganize content or change structure
- Do NOT add new ideas or examples
- Do NOT make the text more formal or academic
- Focus on correctness, not style changes

Output only the refined content. No preamble, no explanation, no meta-commentary.
