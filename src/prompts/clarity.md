## Task

Apply a clarity refinement pass to the content below. Your goal is to improve flow and comprehension while preserving the author's unique voice.

1. **Improve transitions** - Add or strengthen connections between ideas
2. **Clarify ambiguity** - Rewrite unclear references or vague statements
3. **Enhance flow** - Reorder sentences within paragraphs if it helps comprehension
4. **Simplify complexity** - Break down overly complex ideas without dumbing down
5. **Preserve voice** - Maintain the author's tone, vocabulary, and personality

Important:
- Do NOT add new ideas or examples unless essential for clarity
- Do NOT change the author's vocabulary to simpler words unnecessarily
- Do NOT make text more formal or academic
- Do NOT change the overall structure or argument flow
- Focus on making existing ideas clearer, not changing them

Output only the refined content. No preamble, no explanation, no meta-commentary.
